# Write a function that, when given a list of characters as a comma separated
# string, returns a string containing all except the first and last characters,
# separated by spaces. If the input string is empty, or the removal of the first
# and last items would cause the string to be empty, return null value. Arrays
# are joined by adding a single space between each consecutive array element.
